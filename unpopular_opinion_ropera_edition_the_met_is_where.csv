"I mean.. the Met is where big name has-beens, anyone decent or better not from America (and some not so good), and phenomenal American singers work. That’s just who they hire. 

So many big name singers go back to the Met well past their prime and become part of that first category, and also the topic of your question.",eiovhh3,b1xus9,False,False,Bedquest,2019-03-16 22:07:37
"The real problem is the current “administration” doesn’t believe in taking chances on talent.  They only hire big-names, no matter if they can still sing or not.

And by not taking those chances, by not being courageous enough to bring new talent forward, the Met has single-handedly stalled the progression of opera.

(Yeah yeah, there are tons of other factors... but if you boil it all down, the above listed reason, along with the Met HD broadcasts, has done more harm to opera than help.)",eir625l,eiovhh3,True,False,Arrabbiato,2019-03-17 20:21:08
"I feel like the Met is pretty good at identifying up and coming talent - they just don't do a good job of building up the singers' careers year over year and casting them in the right roles. For example Lisette Oropesa came through their young artists' program but she mostly sang roles like Sophie in Werther, Gilda in Rigoletto etc. Meanwhile the European houses saw her talent and gave her the career-making soprano roles like La Traviata, Lucia di Lammermoor etc. and now the Met has finally brought her back (after a 3 year absence). Amanda Majeski is another one, she is seemingly typecast to play 1 Mozart role per year at the Met (and isn't even contracted next season) but I saw her sing the Composer in Ariadne auf Naxos in Santa Fe, where she was wonderful, and she won rave reviews singing the title role of Katya Kabanova in London earlier this year. But I just feel like the Met picks their favorites (Netrebko / Garanca / Yoncheva / Damrau / Leonard etc., looks like Susanna Phillips is one for next season as well) and don't take risks on the up and coming singers they have.",eisd9aw,eir625l,True,False,ugen64,2019-03-18 07:07:05
I agree with that as well.,eiseilb,eisd9aw,True,False,Arrabbiato,2019-03-18 07:42:50
"Yeah I definitely think they book most singers past their prime. Damrau is the most recent example, but the essentially waste home grown talent like Oropesa ",eip5lgq,b1xus9,False,False,Ihveseen,2019-03-17 00:21:22

"The goal of the met is to sell tickets. The money cares about names, and that’s why the up and comers get shoved into bohemes and the holiday flute first. The upper east side haven’t gone to see Boheme since the zef production was new. HD has to have a little bit of star pull as well so Karen in Iowa who has no idea who pretty yende is, buys a ticket. 

Nothing happened to Netrebko, she’s as good now as she’s ever been. 

There are outstanding singers at the met, and there are names. They’re both contracted in volume. ",eip71ba,b1xus9,False,False,verdammtertag,2019-03-17 00:40:43
Thank you for sticking up for Netrebko. Saw her a year or two ago at the Tucker Gala. She owned everyone on that stage.,eipx427,eip71ba,True,False,Reginald_Waterbucket,2019-03-17 08:37:05

I would be happier if they had dual cast Netrebko in the upcoming Macbeth production. ,eit3fhm,eip71ba,True,False,madonna-boy,2019-03-18 15:35:54

"The Met has a need to sell tickets and it comes at the expense of the singers as much as the audiences. I know some of the principles in their current Ring and they are literally in HD broadcasts this season, and they’re not scheduled to sing at all next season in one case, or they’re being passed over for their signature roles bc someone with a better name is contracted instead. It’s a business and Peter Gelb has said he’d rather have a lackluster soprano on stage screaming through Vissi d’Arte that can pull a 90+% occupancy than someone with pura voce and captivating presence who can only manage a 60% filled house. It’s a 4000 seat house and the downside is that it’s expensive as hell to operate in, so if genuine artistry can only half fill it, that doesn’t butter the bread so they have to bring past-prime names that will allow them to operate.",eir1vlx,b1xus9,False,False,jolivier7,2019-03-17 19:30:25
"I think this happens in most theathres, big or small. Names sell, even if they don t sound well. For example, most simon boccanegras of the last 15 years seem to be sabg by nucci or domingo, great singers in their time but what the hell.
I dont think netrebko is dying , the problem is that she sometimes is miscast (her leonora really!). Heard her live in concert with mr netrebko. Concert was hideous but her voice sounded healthy.

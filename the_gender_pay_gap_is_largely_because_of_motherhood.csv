2,"My anecdotal experiences (software business).

The women that I know with kids that have partners who do an equal job raising the kids (or in two cases significantly more because the fathers are stay-at-home parents) have had absolutely no problem rising in their chosen professions and make fat buck. No changes required by their employers other than to provide a milking room so they could pump and the short-time disability time to recover from birth.

The women that I know with kids that either have partners that are completely useless or who the women who insist on being martyrs (i.e., no one can do a better job, so they won't let anyone else help) usually *do* have a problem rising in the ranks because they are simply not present as much as the rest of us.

The few single/divorced/widowed men that I know who have sole/primary custody of their kids also don't advance as fast because they are also not as present.

Women need to insist that their partners do an equal share of childcare (or they shouldn't breed with those partners who are unwilling) - the physical as well as the mental load, and they need to not micro-manage those partners who do step up. I have seen a few men trying to be good fathers, but their wives just go absolutely nuts if the guys don't do things exactly as the women would do them. The kid isn't going to die because the father used the blue bowl with elephants instead of the green bowl with ducks.

10,"In the Netherlands a pay-gap is literally illegal. I started a new job last year. If a woman of same age started the same job at the same time we would start at the same salary, period. Collective bargaining agreement means I can literally look-up the salary I'm supposed to have and can sue if I'm making less. (Pay rises on a fixed scale too. Only thing that can influence a quicker rise is better performance and is also set in the stones of the CBA)    
All my female peers always were on the same payscale and making exactly what they should be making on the CBA adjusted for years at the job and performance reviews.    
      
There is however a massive earnings-gap in the Netherlands...
All the coworkers I've had who got pregnant were immediatly excitedly talking about how they were going to be working less when the baby got there. Dutch law also means companies cannot even (completely) stop you from doing this ""because babies"". Even hinting at dad doing the same would get you completely excommunicated from the workfloor social circle. Like suggesting the dad should also be home for kiddo is the same as saying ""all babies should be murdered"".     
Not a single woman I've seen decided to keep her full-time when baby happened.     
Working less -> Less earnings from hourly wages.    
Also less hours -> Less chance of promotion (because if the higher position requires 40hours and mommy only works 20, she ain't going to get it. Companies aren't going to hire 2 people for 1 spot unless mommy is super awesome at her job) -> lesser lifetime earnings due to slower rising wages.     
And the worse part? It doesn't even look like it's improving. Heck, last I read (can't find the source right now) it seemed to be getting worse with more and more women opting to start working less (or simply quit outright) as soon as the fucktrophy popped. Completely baffling.

34,"I had a variation of this at one job. I was a unix/linux system administrator and a dozen years into my career when I was hired by a well-known US public university. A year later there was a reorg and I was moved into a different position where the salaries of my new coworkers (who were all men) were all much higher than the salaries of previous team. My boss had me reclassified as a junior position and retaining my existing salary even though I had more experience than some of my coworkers. On average they were paid 33&#37; more than me and the next lowest was 25&#37; more than my salary. I negotiated and was told that I had to have a year in the position with performance review showing that I was doing the new position well enough to deserve the raise. This was even though I met all of the requirements in the job description.

With a great performance review under my belt and acknowledging that I had performed as well as the senior staff I negotiated. Since we were state employees our salaries were public information so I looked it up (a local newspaper had posted all state employee salaries on their website, making this very easy for me) and I brought that and additional information: the relative years of experience, years of state service and degrees completed of my coworkers. Hours of meetings with my management later I had used facts to defeat all of their arguments against me being paid in the range. After that my management entrenched in the position of ""it would be unfair to your coworkers to pay you the same as them."" Hours more of negotiation attempts just saw them repeat that phrase in response to everything I presented - clearly they were dead set against me being paid any closer to what my colleagues were.

Then the constructive dismissal began. I got out for a job with another employer before they could try to fire me and did so in part because of how obvious it was that the constructive dismissal was afoot. It included policies being more strict for me, such as on-call. On-call was a weekly rotation among everyone in the department. Management considered it acceptable if my coworkers responded to on-call issues, even production servers down unexpectedly, within 90+ minutes (I was never able to establish the upper boundary) and delays due to being off campus for lunch were acceptable. Of me they required 10 minutes and I was directly told that when I was on call I was not allowed to leave campus for lunch.

My all-time favorite take-away from that job was my management criticizing me for only working 40 hours per week. We were salaried and they admitted I was getting my work done and to spec, just doing it faster than my coworkers, and the reason for that was that I didn't socialize or work on non-work related side-projects while in office like my coworkers did (because I would get a reprimand from management if I did either.) I realized it was that they had no negative to use to mark me down in my annual review and had an irrational need to have something negative on it.",e29o28r,e2992ca,True,OhDaniGal,2018-07-12 17:54:17

On the other hand, in some professions, fatherhood often results in a pay bonus (even controlling for hours worked and experience) when compared to even single, child-free men. This is often due to a bias that men with children are more responsible and will work more hours to provide, [even if this isn't necessarily the case](https://globalnews.ca/news/4278178/daddy-bonus/).

62,"This is actually false, the seeking promotions and salary is often only a much smaller part of the pay gap. It really is motherhood that is the source of the largest hit. If you track women who never have kids with men, the difference in pay is much smaller. It is women dropping out of the workforce after they had children., Likewise the biggest contributor to poverty is also having a child. The younger one has a child, the more likely one is to be poor.

The smartest thing a woman can do in terms of both her pay, and avoiding poverty is to never have children. All of the recent studies have shown, it is indeed having children behind most of the gender pay gap. Take children out of the picture and the pay gap is minimal once you control for profession.

If you take away motherhood penalty, which is self imposed, since having a kid is a choice, and dropping out of the labor force is going to negatively effect ones pay, then the difference is 5&#37;-8&#37; between men and women. Once you add those with kids to the picture that is when it skyrockets. The pay gap is very real, but much less. It is having kids that causes the problems. Again, having kids is a choice, and women need to be much better informed about how it negatively economically effects them, negatively effects their bodies, and will negatively effect other aspects of their life. They need to cut out the Instagram and emotional crap, and cut to the harsh reality and data. Have children at your own peril, as it can be a one way ticket to poverty, lifelong physical suffering, career suicide, relationship destruction, and sometimes actual death. Is having a child something that is worth the risk at all. When one can have real freedom, as supposed to being shackled to raising a child and the numerous downsides to that.

Yes someone needs to stay at home and i am a great supporter for sahm and sahd because they can care for a child on an extremely personal way. If i wanted a child this would be my goal, i wouldnt put it in kindergarden for 9+h, i would want to know i did as best as a can to give them the most beautiful childhood. But nowhere is it mandatory for the mother to be the one who is at home. Every single relationship can luckily decide themselves who does so. If women plan to work and have a child they need to choose a career that makes them earn enough for this decision. Even if they dont want to stay at home for pregnancy they have a choice, there are enough children who would need to be adopted. It is a great decision and way to help a child while fulfilling your dream of parenthood.

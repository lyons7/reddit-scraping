Original Message: I would like to add the expectation that all women want to have kids. We can be promoted less frequently than men if it's perceived that we will take time off for child rearing. This isn't so much a wage gap issue but an issue that aligns more with the fewer numbers of women in top positions. Additionally, many women do take time off for children and could be missing those promotions that way too.

Original Message: I work with a lot of women that are currently having kids or have young kids.  It does make them worse at their jobs.  Full stop. And I'm not going to apologize for that statement.

They're late or out because the kid is sick.  They're not around to get that valuable face time with higher-ups.  When they're needed in a pinch, they can't show up.  They can't unexpectedly stay late for time-sensitive tasks, and they can't come in at 0600 for that early meeting with command. My biggest concern in those situations is missing my yoga class. Even the women that have older children in high school are having issues with being out due to their kids' needs. Watching the women around me flounder at their careers and jobs due to their young children cemented my decision for me.

Original Message: Childfree now: blames sexism on women.

There’s research that shows(in America) that women with children are treated with less respect in a workplace than a man with children. They are given less promotions, they are given less pay. The wage gap research does not include non-working women and for black and Latino women the gap is so much more.
Get your heads out of your asses childfree and understand that child care in America is way to expensive. It’s not right that giving birth hits you with a 20k fee, that supporting your child through college is a whopping 200k and most parents never do it. When I was born, college education was never this bad.
Also can any of you ever understand lower class single mothers? Are you going to call them negligent? That they chose to have kids so they can’t complain that raising a child in the lower class is fucking hard? Or can any of you for once recognize that the system is shit, that it’s shit for working mothers, that narratives are shit for childfree folks, that internalized misogyny in some women with kids that causes them to call cf people lesser is shit too.
Jfc.

Original Message: And in Denmark where this data is from, men have very very VERY good oppertunities to share the "load" so to speak, in so far as they can take paternity leave for a long time. There is also affordable childcare and children cheques from the state. I mention this because its important to note that women who become mothers are CHOOSING to stay home for longer than the men, and that choice, along with the choice to have a child - along with what job they chose, is whats causing the wage gap. In Denmark, and Im sure most countries in the west, it is COMPLETELY ILLEGAL to pay less for doing the same job, based on gender. Further along on this tangent;

While Im all for blaming the kids, it probably doesnt help if you chose to become a social worker, and the data compares you without regard for that, with men working on oil rigs or as engineers. - Pay gap as something purely based on whats between your legs is a myth, but often touted as a result of some kind of overlording misogynistic tendency in our society! We get payed the same for the same work, if we have the same qualifications, and work dedication. Take time off, to weave a basket, make a baby or chose a job that pays less, then yeah it will look like there is a wage gap if you dont consider those details when making the comparison.

I understand people get ragey about this topic, but for me as a CF woman, I do not think its fair that a womans personal choice to have a baby and thus work less, and be less reliable at her job, should be overlooked when looking at wage increases or promotions. Some people actually, alot of them, believe that its a womans right, and duty and some kind of godly sacrifice to have babies, and that she shouldnt be "punished" for that decission.

Where I am from, its called PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY - for the consequences of your choice. And frankly I feel women who want to argue that they are missing out and its everyone elses fault, are arguing for all the rights of the men, but without all that pesky personal responsibility.

So yeah...

Original Message: On average though, the women are taking the majority of the time off for all things relating to child rearing. Several months of recovery after the birth followed by doctors appointments for check-ups and vaccinations, etc, it’s statistically done more often by the mothers. I’m not saying it’s right or wrong, each household/family should make the choices that most benefit their lifestyles.

Personally, I don’t have a problem with women or men making less because they’re away from the workplace more. I don’t care if the reason is kids or a kangaroo farm, if you’re not putting in the hours and learning as much as the people who are, you don’t deserve the promotions and raises as much. I’ve had one consecutive week off in the 11 years I’ve put in with my company and only two people at my location make more than me. I am a woman and I would be offended if someone who hadn’t shown the dedication I have was making more, genders and children aside, if you aren’t working as hard or harder than the person next to you, you won’t be rewarded equally.

If you choose to have children, that’s the lifestyle you’ve chosen and if it means you missing more work than your coworkers, you should accept that, as a consequence of that, you may not progress as quickly or as far as your peers.

No it's not. That might be a part of it but it's a tiny amount. The main reasons is women are more likely to be in lower paying jobs (such as cleaning and teaching). They are also less likely to be in senior positions (for various reasons - prejudice; lack of confidence; expectation of working longer hours which they can't commit to due to doing more childcare). They are more likely to be in part-time jobs, which are below their skillset, due to taking on more childcare responsibility.

The hiring side is tricky. In my experience mothers usually mention their children at least once in an interview. But because of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act you can't just not hire someone because they are a woman. There are well-qualified hard-working mom's out there. There are also mom's who take off work every time Timmy sneezes.

It's almost impossible to know if a younger woman intends to have children or not unless she asks about or shows interest in maternity leave benefits.

She is so so so happy she had kids in her early 20’s compared to her friends who are having kids in their 30’s. Her favorite part about it all is that she is under 45 years old, both kids are about to be moved out, and her and my father are able to enjoy their free time in their early 40’s as if they were child free (to an extent). Me and my sister both support ourselves for the most part so everything they earn goes towards paying off debt, family vacations, new cars, etc.

Original Message: In the US there are studies that focus on the wage gap per-profession, so it takes out the element where one is choosing a different career. Basically it the stats control for profession. (You compare for the same profession and position.) When you do this you basically end up finding out that most of the wage gap is around childrearing. A childfree woman who is a software engineer makes the same as a man. But a woman who has children may make less because she dropped out of the workforce to have kids, only works part time, etc. Again this is how it has to be studied, because you have to remove the factor of occupational choice and educational attainment.

Original Message: I don't get why more people don't see this. It seems so obvious to me. Marriage and raising children seems like a much riskier endeavor for women, not just because of the physical implications of childbirth, but the fact that her "life" gets put on hold to rear the children. In an age where technology is developing so fast, taking a year off puts you behind the curve. Now if you take five years off to get your two kids through infancy and preschool, how far behind are you? Because this role generally falls on the female in the relationship, her career has stalled considerably. Now what happens when the marriage dissolves? Dads career trajectory never took a hit! Moms career trajectory STOPPED for a considerable amount of time, leaving her less employable, less promotable, earning less, etc.

I end up picking up their slack because they stay home with the kid if it so much as sniffles, and they seem to feel that it’s completely fine because I don’t have kids so clearly I have no life and can work 60 hours a week because when you don’t have a kid who cares, right? When I was in college I waited tables and the girls with kids told me that they needed the better sections because they need the money more than I do because they have kids and I don’t, yet they were the ones getting their nails done every week and buying new phones while I searched my house for change so I could buy gas to get to work in the first place.

I understand why companies don’t want to hire or promote women with kids. A huge factor in my decision not to have kids was that I wanted to have a career and be successful and not be held back by a kid. I felt that not having children would mean that companies would see me as someone who is more promotable or hirable than someone with kids. I know that not all mothers are like the ones I’ve dealt with, but the reality is that a lot of them are. How can you count on someone who is going to need constant time off because their kid is sick? How would you know if their kid is actually sick and they’re not using it as a convenient excuse to not work?

Original Message: The slack that we pick up as childfree people is there for us to pick up because we still have a system which treats parenthood like this inconvenient thing that your employees do rather than a biological imperative for a huge number of people. Employers could offer flex time. They could offer better paid time off packages. They could offer subsidized childcare close to employment hubs. You know things that make it easier on those who choose to have children so that those who choose to not have children don't have to pick up the slack for the employer's lack of preparation.

Maybe in twenty years when robots are amazing and we've had a couple of pandemics knock out 40% of the un-vaccinated population and we're much better at not trying to legislate morality by controlling women's bodies and access to contraception and family planning, we'll finally enter a world of sustained population decline that doesn't matter or hurt because Rosie the Robot Maid is there to do the hard work no one wants to do. But until then, we still need some women to make new humans, and we would all be far better served if we stopped being so systemically hostile to parenthood. I want to retire some day and I need someone to make some tax paying babies so I don't have to work until I keel over.

Yeah there will always be crap people who use their kids as an excuse for their lack of planning, but if you have a system that given them a decent option and they still try to pawn off their lateness/laziness on the kid, then they can be disciplined and dealt with and they can either shape up or seek employment elsewhere.

I wish to not be brainwashed. Show me a reliable link please so that I may educate myself. I hate the idea of anyone looking embarrassing in this thread.

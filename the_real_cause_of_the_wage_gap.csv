But seriously, it's another reason that I don't want kids. I value my money, time and silence. I'm not saying that this is the way it should be (many mothers are incredibly hard working people), but it is our reality and I don't want anything to do with it. 

I personally believe people should be paid what they're worth, gender and parenthood should have nothing to do with it, unless they constantly use their kids as an excuse to not do their job. We all know the breeders who use ""little Brayxtonne"" as their reason for not doing anything all the fucking time, but we also know the hard working parents who use their kids as a reason to do better, the kind that want to set a positive example for their kids.

They're late or out because the kid is sick.  They're not around to get that valuable face time with higher-ups.  When they're needed in a pinch, they can't show up.  They can't unexpectedly stay late for time-sensitive tasks, and they can't come in at 0600 for that early meeting with command. My biggest concern in those situations is missing my yoga class.

44,"It is more complicated.
One, impact of having a child depends in whether the state protects the rights of working mothers, actively supports fathers looking after their kids, and provides free child care. If both parents take the same amount of time off (because that is the only way to get maximum parental leave), and it isn't much time, and they can't be fired in the interim, and there are part time options or even childcare at the workplace, this effect is strongly mitigated.
Two, while women being expected to look after the kids, take a huge break from work and hence miss a promotion, instead losing touch with relevant skills, is a major factor, it is not the only one. Women are also socialised to get training in jobs like nursing rather than, say, engineering, which, while equally essential, are horribly paid. Plus, they are socialised to be less pushy negotiating for wages, and are judged more harshly if they do. Plus sexism in offering jobs and promotions and raises.

122,"And in Denmark where this data is from, men have very very VERY good oppertunities to share the ""load"" so to speak, in so far as they can take paternity leave for a long time. There is also affordable childcare and children cheques from the state. I mention this because its important to note that women who become mothers are CHOOSING to stay home for longer than the men, and that choice, along with the choice to have a child - along with what job they chose, is whats causing the wage gap. In Denmark, and Im sure most countries in the west, it is COMPLETELY ILLEGAL to pay less for doing the same job, based on gender. Further along on this tangent;

While Im all for blaming the kids, it probably doesnt help if you chose to become a social worker, and the data compares you without regard for that, with men working on oil rigs or as engineers. - Pay gap as something purely based on whats between your legs is a myth, but often touted as a result of some kind of overlording misogynistic tendency in our society! We get payed the same for the same work, if we have the same qualifications, and work dedication. Take time off, to weave a basket, make a baby or chose a job that pays less, then yeah it will look like there is a wage gap if you dont consider those details when making the comparison.

I understand people get ragey about this topic, but for me as a CF woman, I do not think its fair that a womans personal choice to have a baby and thus work less, and be less reliable at her job, should be overlooked when looking at wage increases or promotions. Some people actually, alot of them, believe that its a womans right, and duty and some kind of godly sacrifice to have babies, and that she shouldnt be ""punished"" for that decission.

Where I am from, its called PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY - for the consequences of your choice. And frankly I feel women who want to argue that they are missing out and its everyone elses fault, are arguing for all the rights of the men, but without all that pesky personal responsibility.

No it's not. That might be a part of it but it's a tiny amount. The main reasons is women are more likely to be in lower paying jobs (such as cleaning and teaching). They are also less likely to be in senior positions (for various reasons - prejudice; lack of confidence; expectation of working longer hours which they can't commit to due to doing more childcare). They are more likely to be in part-time jobs, which are below their skillset, due to taking on more childcare responsibility.

The reason the disparities on the unadjusted wage gap are so big is that women, on average, take a lot more time off of work to raise their children. Obviously, the difference in work experience will impact the career path and subsequently the wage. 

For most countries, the adjusted wage gap is only a few cents, which means that women are still getting paid less than men for the same work all conditions being the same but not by a lot. 

If you want to spark outrage you're obviously going to use the unadjusted wage gap and that's the number most people are familiar with, leading some people to say that the difference in wages can be **almost** exclusively attributed to whether or not a woman has children.

190,"It's sadly a more complicated issue than a lot of people give it credit for especially in places with somewhat fair maternity leave.

I mean from an employers perspective you have an employee that can more or less leave their position for sometimes over a year with relatively short notice and you'll still have to pay them (not full salary but still) and have their position available when they decide to return. This means that whoever you manage to get as a replacement will have to go somewhere else when the original employee returns.

Depending on the position and company something like that could be not just a huge cost but also a potential for some serious negative consequences.

Even if you could ask on an application what's to stop the woman from lying or just changing their mind?

This is an unfortunate reality and I honestly don't know how to stop it. Forcing shared parental leave has it's own fair share of problems especially for people with lower income or where both parent's don't have a job etc. Not even mentioning single parents or people who can't get an abortion at all or in time.

At the same time most of us would agree that discrimination based on sex isn't a good thing.

(You compare for the same profession and position.) When you do this you basically end up finding out that most of the wage gap is around childrearing. A childfree woman who is a software engineer makes the same as a man. But a woman who has children may make less because she dropped out of the workforce to have kids, only works part time, etc. Again this is how it has to be studied, because you have to remove the factor of occupational choice and educational attainment.

It bothers me so much hearing women even here in Albania raging about earning less than men when nearly all of them decide to have children in their late 20s/early 30s, which is where their careers have a chance of improving. 

I have had women tell me that they should be given paid leave during their periods and still be paid exactly as much as their male coworkers. 

Not to mention that a majority of mothers are by default unreliable workers.
Even from experience, my mom has run several businesses over the years and it is hard to find a male employee that has caused half the work delay and issues that the female ones have due to having children that got sick once a week or got sick themselves and having to leave early or not come in for 3-4 days at a time almost every month.

There is not enough incentive for working women to have children unless you have a family/friend network that is willing and able to help a lot. If you’re wealthy, you can pay for help, but why have kids if you can’t spend that much time with them, and to really enjoy them. Not to say that women who work should feel guilty that their children aren’t getting the care they need If they have nannies and family stepping in, but more - are you getting what you need from deciding to become a mother?

Today, I think that men help a lot more than previous generations, but in my experience it’s still far from equal in regard to men being driven to care for the home and children 50% when both parents are working full time. 

I decided having children made no sense because of the above reasons. 

I also felt apprehensive about taking a break in my career. I’m at a point of growth that I’m really happy with, and despite what Sheryl Sandberg says about taking on more responsibility and getting pregnant anyway, 

I just dont feel that the world around me wants me to have a family:

1. Partner doesn’t have the interest
2. Workplaces are legally supportive, but let’s be honest, it’s not easy on your team or your boss
3. Family is not in a position to help
4. Friends are mostly not having children either, it seems
5. Even with good parenting values, people seem to grow up to love things more than people, so why risk adding to that

Women frequently will also take one job over another because of location, stability, schedule etc solely because of the fact that they have to consider the kids schedules/activities. So you could be “stuck” at a company/job that pays less than you could get else where because you choose the needs of your kids over your own career.

320,"""Gender roles"" are a societal construct the same way gender itself is. Biological sex is a result of biology.

If you're suggesting that all females of all species are biologically pre-determined to take care of children, let me introduce you to [seahorses.](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/seahorse-fathers-take-reins-in-childbirth/) The males become pregnant and give birth in seahorses and their relatives seadragons and pipefish. [Here](https://www.livescience.com/14651-animal-kingdom-devoted-dads.html) is a (poorly formatted, sorry) list of other males who nurture and care for their offspring, rather than the females. Notables: Seahorses, marmosets, penguins, sandpipers (birds), and emus.



There's a matriarchal tribe called the [Mosuo](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/seahorse-fathers-take-reins-in-childbirth/) where the men do not move in with their wife, and a woman's children's father is largely unknown. The men stay with their own family, as determined by their mothers and sisters, and take care of their nieces and nephews.

The [African Aka](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/jun/15/childrensservices.familyandrelationships) people are also traditionally raised by their fathers.

326,"The only way we're ever going to make headway with that kind of behavior is when companies are more parent friendly, in the ways that matter. Subsidizing childcare as a benefit. Flex work so a parent on parental leave can maybe work from home a couple hours a day, or come in part time, or whatever else works for that employer/employee. Decent leave after birth/adoption. 

That last one is so huge. There needs to be decent parental leave policies that both moms and dads can take advantage of. There has to be more friendliness to parents so HR people everywhere can see that someone wanting to get pregnant isn't necessarily their taking a three year productivity break, but something they can work out together because a lot of women will still want to have two legged kids and will have a ton to contribute creatively and that doesn't change because they grew a ten pound meatloaf inside their bodies. A lot of those women leaving the workforce do so because it doesn't make sense to work 40 hours a week to pay someone else 75% of your income for childcare. 

And I feel so bad for childfree women too. Like me at work, finally eveyrone's convinced I'm not going to suddenly wake up yearning for the smell of puke and dirty diapers, but so many others still have to go around trying to convince coworkers that even though they are of childbearing age, they absolutely do not plan to pass a meatloaf sized anything through their cervix because just no.

If we perpetuate a system where only women bear the brunt of a cost that benefits us all, (replenishing a tax paying workforce) then yeah, it is sexist. Plus, you know, there are dudes out there who want to take time off and be with their kids for extended periods and can't afford to do that because of the career/income hit they'd take. Or maybe they want to cut back on work but they can't afford it because their partner's earning potential was hampered by needing to take time out of the workforce to be with an infant.

329,"The slack that we pick up as childfree people is there for us to pick up because we still have a system which treats parenthood like this inconvenient thing that your employees do rather than a biological imperative for a huge number of people. Employers could offer flex time. They could offer better paid time off packages. They could offer subsidized childcare close to employment hubs. You know things that make it easier on those who choose to have children so that those who choose to not have children don't have to pick up the slack for the employer's lack of preparation. 

Maybe in twenty years when robots are amazing and we've had a couple of pandemics knock out 40% of the un-vaccinated population and we're much better at not trying to legislate morality by controlling women's bodies and access to contraception and family planning, we'll finally enter a world of sustained population decline that doesn't matter or hurt because Rosie the Robot Maid is there to do the hard work no one wants to do. But until then, we still need some women to make new humans, and we would all be far better served if we stopped being so systemically hostile to parenthood. I want to retire some day and I need someone to make some tax paying babies so I don't have to work until I keel over.

Yeah there will always be crap people who use their kids as an excuse for their lack of planning, but if you have a system that given them a decent option and they still try to pawn off their lateness/laziness on the kid, then they can be disciplined and dealt with and they can either shape up or seek employment elsewhere.",ehnu5hu,ehnodne,True,molotovmimi,2019-03-02 23:29:33

My last surgery had me completely unable to get up on my own for at least a week, and even then I didn't fully recover until nearly two months had passed.

A man, strictly speaking, doesn't have to recover from anything when a baby is born.

387,"I think I am getting the satisfaction I wanted out of Becoming a mother. I worked in Wall Street and it was difficult to feel satisfied with my career since I was killing myself working to make the rich richer. There’s a tremendous sense of satisfaction as a mom in many different ways, little things like a genuine thank you hug for fixing a toy to seeing my son flourish once I figured out his food intolerances. He is a sweet person and i believe that the values I hold strongly will be imparted to him for life. 

I think no matter how much I “planned” or researched or prepared for the amount of work i was not able to comprehend the level of commitment to parenting needed (if you want to be a good parent I guess) I remember one night when I was still working. I was exhausted, I was pissed that  dinner was steak and steamed vegetables again (steamed vegetables are an affront to my senses and my bf never seasoned them well and I couldn’t eat good food because I had to cut out all top allergens) so I was tired and unhappy with dinner and I just wanted  to sleep but I had to run a load of baby clothes and do his dishes because I take to school  the next day and bathe him and feed him. I realized that night that the work would never end. I didn’t have a to do list with a finite number of checks before I could rest and relax, there would always be work to do because he had to eat and be taken care of every day forever. 

Like you said, dads today do allot more than previous generations but even in my fairly liberal and modern social group, dads at best carry about 20% of the workload and maybe 10% of the mental load and that’s a big burden in itself. 

I’m very honest with my friends and family that parenting is incredibly difficult and exhausting and the return on investment is purely intangibles and at random. My kid was born with a rare birth defect that was thankfully resolved with the first month of life but it made me acutely aware that at any moment something can happen and you’re making yourself the one responsible for this entire human. You can have a perfect 10 years with a kid when some rare disease or freak accident makes them need lifetime round the clock care.

423,">The exception, in my mind, is if the women are voluntarily pulling back at work to be a mom.   In that case, they have chosen to put home life first and should not expect to receive the same promotions as someone who dedicates themselves to their career. 
  
This is true, but often there is a cultural expectation that women will be the caregiver. Also, there are things that the government/workplacehs can do to help women in the workplace. For example, in Sweden each parent gets 3 months parental leave that they must use or they will lose it (and it can't be transferred to the other parent). In many other countries, the women gets most of the parental leave, thus removing the ""choice"" to stay at home.  
  
Also, there is often an expectation at senior levels that you must ""dedicate yourself"" to your career and work long hours. This removes the ""choice"" from the woman as she is usually expected to care for the child. My current organisation is really good at flexible working. My boss works compressed hours so he takes off 1 day a week to look after his child. *His* boss has just come back from maternity leave, and she works from home 3 days a week so she can reduce the time spent commuting. I haven't seen this kind of flexibility in other companies I've worked with, which is reflected in the high number of women in senior positions.

464,"Fair call. I deserved that. I imagine that starting out as a woman in the workforce in the 80's you would have most certainly had the odds stacked against you, and in the arts the odds to make good money probably even more so. I genuinely hope that you got into that field because it was your passion and that enjoyed it.
But for young women entering the workforce now I just don't buy it that that's the case anymore. The statistics show that females are getting more degrees, women in their 20s are earning more than men the same age, and this continues up until roughly the start of typical ""breeding"" years where the women who choose to go off and have kids start bringing those average earnings figures down, as the graph above shows. If you're a young woman wanting to get into STEM fields in particular, now has never been a better time. There are so many scholarships, jobs programs, govt policies and initiatives to get young women into STEM that in my profession (engineering) barely a day goes by that I don't hear about it.
From what I've seen in engineering and architecture, these (for the record, usually very competent) young women who decide to have kids, more often than not don't return to the workforce in the same capacity. They might come back a few days a week, or only work say 9-3pm to fit in with school hours, or something like that. By all means their partner could be the one who does that, but ultimately that is a private decision for them to make as a family. None of my business.

466,"This was originally a debate about the wage gap, and like it or not, that is going to be present mostly in white collar intelligence economy jobs because the other stuff is going to go to the robots in no time. Sadly those entry level service jobs tend to be the type where an employee's earning potential is stagnant from the get go and the employee is easily replaceable so it doesn't matter to the company whether they are flexible or accommodating to parents. They'll just hire someone else.

And for the jobs with the time sensitive decisions, there are ways to be flexible around that too. That senior person can have someone in the company read in on their projects and able to make some decisions, but they also need to have more access. The company gives you flexibility to be with your little bundle of diaper,  but you also have to give back a bit. It can be negotiated. Humans are really good at compromise when there is a common goal that benefits both parties. None of that can happen without a significant culture change tho. And until it does, it'll be those of us who worship at the Church-of-My-Uterus-Is-Just-For-Fun who wind up picking up the slack.

I was not suggesting that there be a quota of 50/50 (basically affirmative action) for these positions.  I am saying that if you accept that women are as capable as men at performing their jobs then on average they should be promoted at the same rate.   If 50% of entry level positions are given to women and those women are just as good at their jobs as the men then statistically 50% of the higher level job promotions would be given to women.

In order to accept that a 30% women / 70% men at a higher level is fair you'd have to believe that only 30% of women can compete  with 70% of men (or basically only the top females can compete with the majority of guys).

It is odd because i feel like I’m always dissuading those around me to become parents and I advocate for strong consideration to the practical and non love based side of parenting, so I worry people think I regret it and I don’t. Not at all. I always had a fear that I didn’t have the ability to love because I had a hard childhood -the feeling some people have for their siblings or parents or family is allot less deep then what I know I feel to my family despite them still being in my life and close to me now, I think there were things that prevented that biological feeling of love to develop between us. So to be able to finally experience that “I love you so stinking much I’m gonna squash you with my hugs” love is worth every sacrifice and cost.

I don't believe you. Hence my initial comment. If you want to have a conversation about that, prove it.

> If you “genuinely care”, look it up

I did. The only sources I could find that say this are clearly not reputable. Most are (surprise!) MRA and red pill organizations. I do not consider these reliable sources especially since the studies they reference are either poorly conducted or have such small sample sizes as to render them insignificant.

> Also, having to look at someone’s post history to judge their comment is ad hominem and only proves you people are close minded individuals who don’t want their fantasy world disrupted by logic

You people? Which people are you talking about, exactly? Also, I don't think your participation in what I would consider misguided communities makes you wrong. What it does do, however, is indicate to me that you spend time in communities that I, frankly, do not have a lot of respect for. My lack of respect for these communities lies primarily in the way that they twist and obfuscate information to further their particular social agenda. If I'm wrong about this by all means prove me wrong. I've yet to hear arguments come out of these communities that are well justified and persuasive.",ehmyuxd,ehmy04v,True,DisheveledJesus,2019-03-02 16:57:44
